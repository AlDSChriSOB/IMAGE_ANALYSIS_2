# IMAGE_ANALYSIS_2
Animal Image Classification with TensorFlow Keras (Similar to previous code)
This code appears to be setting up an image classification model using TensorFlow Keras, likely for classifying animal photos from a dataset. However, there seems to be an incompleteness as the val_ds (validation dataset) definition is missing the closing parenthesis.

Based on the similarities with the previous code, here's a breakdown of the provided code:

1. Library Imports

Standard libraries for data manipulation (numpy), file system interaction (os), image processing (PIL), and deep learning (tensorflow).
Keras (keras and layers from tensorflow.keras) for building the neural network model.
pathlib for working with file paths (not used in the provided code snippet).
2. Data Path

data_dir is set to "D:\Animal_photos" specifying the location of the animal photos dataset.
3. Hyperparameters (commented out)

Comments indicate potential hyperparameters for image size (img_height and img_width) and batch size (batch_size) but they are not assigned values in this code block.
4. Training Dataset Definition (Incomplete)

train_ds is defined using tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory to load the training dataset from the specified directory.
The following arguments are likely used:
data_dir: Path to the animal photos directory.
validation_split=0.2: Splits the data into 80% training and 20% validation sets (commented out).
subset="training": Specifies loading the training subset of the data (commented out).
seed=123: Sets a random seed for splitting the data (commented out).
image_size=(img_height, img_width): Resizes images to the specified dimensions (commented out without values for height and width).
batch_size=batch_size: Defines the batch size for training (commented out without a value for batch size).
5. Validation Dataset Definition (Incomplete)

The definition for val_ds (validation dataset) starts using tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory but is missing a closing parenthesis. It likely mirrors the structure of train_ds with the same arguments but specifying subset="validation" to load the validation subset.
Missing Parts:

The script defines hyperparameters but doesn't assign them values.
Comments suggest validation set creation but the code is incomplete.
The rest of the code for building, training, and evaluating the model is likely missing.
Overall, this code snippet appears to be the initial setup for training an image classification model on animal photos. You would need to complete the val_ds definition, assign values to hyperparameters, and implement the model building, training, and evaluation stages.
